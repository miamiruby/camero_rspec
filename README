# TDD/Rspec Camero
#
# Scenario:
#
## Base Car Class
# + current speed (property) – default value 0
# + brand (property) - default value ‘unknown’
# + max speed (property) - default value 0
# + accelerate (method)
# + drive (method)
#
# Camaro Car Class
# + Inherits Base Car
# + brand (property) - default value ‘Chevy’
# + max speed (property) – default value 200 
#
# Code Scenario: Can should be able to drive
# In this example we will create an instance of Camaro and tell it to drive, we will assume it’s moving in a straight line and there are no other driving factors.
#
# Code Scenario: Can should be able to accelerate to maxium speed

# The car will accelerate until it hits its max speed.
# It is required that drive will call accelerate. 
# It is required accelerate will increment the current speed by 1.  
# Once the Camaro reaches max speed it should stop accelerating and print that it hit the cars max speed.
# The execution of drive should then also stop.
